# THE FORENSICS CATEGORY !

In a CTF context, "Forensics" challenges can include file format analysis, steganography, memory dump analysis, or network packet capture analysis. Any challenge to examine and process a hidden piece of information out of static data files (as opposed to executable programs or remote servers) could be considered a Forensics challenge.

## Memory dump analysis
- [Volatility](https://www.volatilityfoundation.org/) : Best tool to analyse memory dumps ! (requires python2 and installation is a bit complicated but it does the job well !)

## Disk Image reconstruction
- [FTK Imager](https://www.exterro.com/ftk-imager) : Very nice tool to rebuild Disk Images

## Network packet capture analysis
- The best in the game : [Wireshark !](https://www.wireshark.org/)
