# Cryptography tools
- [**Dcode**](https://www.dcode.fr/identification-chiffrement) : The first (and by far the best) tool is undoubtedly this one. Indeed, it is very useful to determine a type of encryption and it obviously allows to decrypt any kind of encrypted message (for example, it allows to make a decomposition in prime factors for RSA).
- [**CyberChef**](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) : This tool is surely the most used for cryptography. It is also used in other categories, such as forensics. It allows a lot of things that Dcode doesn't, like putting a file as input or go through several ciphers at the same time.
- [**PlanetCalc**](https://fr.planetcalc.com/search/?section=5033) : This tool is sometimes useful for cryptography.
- [**WolframAlpha**](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) : This tool is useful when a calculation is needed (for example, to find the expression of a recursive function).
- [**RsaCtfTool**](https://github.com/Ganapati/RsaCtfTool) : One of the most useful tools (if not the most useful) for deciphering the RSA. It is very easy to use and to install and allows a lot of things: generate a public/private key, retrieve the parameters of a key,...
- [**Base64decode**](https://www.base64decode.org/) : This tool is particularly useful for decrypting base64 and especially for decrypting encrypted files.
- [**CrackStation**](https://crackstation.net/) : This tool allows you to decrypt a hash online.
- [**Morse Decoder**](https://morsedecoder.com/) : This is the best tool for Morse code translation.
